    "description": "You're the first student of the now-retired professor, and now that they've retired, you're given the mantle of chief researcher. Eager to dive into fields where your old professor dove off, you start looking into the concept explored in the seventh lemma - sequential limits - to further your career.\n\nThis theory explores the concept of approximations using a rearrangement of Stirling's Formula to approximate Euler's number.\nThe formula, named after James Stirling and first stated by Abraham De Moivre, states that ln(n!) can be approximated by the infinite sum ln(1) + ln(2) .... + ln(n).\nBe careful - the closer your approximation of Euler's number is, the less your numerator grows!\nA close balancing game, fun for the whole family (or at least, the ones who play Exponential Idle). \n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\nGilles-Philippe, for development of the custom theory SDK, implementing features I requested, providing countless script examples, and help with my numerous questions and balancing.\n\nXelaroc/AlexCord, for answering my neverending questions, debugging and helping me understand how to balance a theory, and going above and beyond to teach me how custom theories work.\n\nThe Exponential Idle beta testing team\n- The Exponential Idle translation team, who's work I added to, and without which this game wouldn't have the reach it does.\n\nEnjoy!",

    "description": "Exploit the inaccuracy of sine's product representation, a result due to Euler which was rigorously proved later by Weierstraß using his famous Factorization Theorem.\n\nIntuitively, the idea behind this formula is to factorize sine using its roots (sine has zeros at each multiple of π), just as one would do for a polynomial.\n\nThe product s_n represents only the n first factors of this infinite product (together with the root at x=0), which means there is some error between s_n(x) and the actual sin(x), depending on n and x. Note that this truncated product s_n approximates sin(x) better for bigger n and smaller x, in particular the approximation becomes bad for a fixed n when x gets large in the sense that the ratio s_n(x)/sin(x) diverges for x -> infty.\n\nHere, the derivative of q with respect to time is set to s_n(χ)/sin(χ) i.e. the ratio from before evaluated at χ (chi), which itself is a value depending on n. Note that increasing n both increases χ and the accuracy of the approximation s_n.",
